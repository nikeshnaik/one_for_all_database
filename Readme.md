# One For All Database


A database that supports every type of data, this idea came from mulit-modal AI models and thought of building a toy database to suppport all data right from row-based, column-based, json, blocks, time series etc.

The goal was I wanted to learn system programming with Go but gave up after looking at llama.c and how C is still the king. So I will be building this project in Python and then translate it to C and other languages like Zig just for fun.

Also another goal is if it is possible then try to make it a distributed system. So I can kill multiple birds with one project. Its long term project of 2years minimum or even 10yrs.
